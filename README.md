The number line paradigm is one of the commonly utilized methods in applying the **Construal Level Theory (CLT)**. Typically employed to assess individuals' perceptual distances regarding abstract concepts such as time and social relationships, this paradigm involves presenting a designated segment of a number line. The common format includes providing a number line and specifying its properties and meanings (e.g., whether the number line is of finite or infinite length, representing a finite or infinite duration). Participants are then instructed to calibrate the perceived length of experimental stimuli within their minds by moving a point along the number line.

This script is based on the implementation of the number line paradigm using MATLAB Psychtoolbox-3 in the context of the Construal Level Theory.


数轴范式是**解释水平理论**常用的范式之一，一般用于测量个体对时间、社会关系等抽象概念的距离知觉。其常见形式是给出一段数轴并说明其性质及含义(比如数轴有限长或无限长，代表一段有限时间或无限时间)，要求被试通过移动数轴上的点以标定实验材料在被试心中的长度。

本脚本是基于MATLAB psychtoolbox-3对数轴范式的实现。
