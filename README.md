# PsychAxis
*Scripts used to achieve the measurement of all sorts of psychological distance, which based on MATLAB psychtoolbox-3*

Number axis paradigm is one of the commonly used paradigms in **structural level theory**, which is generally used to measure individual distance perception of abstract concepts such as time and social relations. Its common form is to give a number axis and explain its nature and meaning (for example, the number axis is finite or infinite, representing a finite time or infinite time). Subjects are required to evaluate the length of experimental materials in the hearts of subjects by moving points on the number axis.

The present scripts is the realization of number axis paradigm based on MATLAB psychtoolbox-3.


数轴范式是**解释水平理论**常用的范式之一，一般用于测量个体对时间、社会关系等抽象概念的距离知觉。其常见形式是给出一段数轴并说明其性质及含义(比如数轴有限长或无限长，代表一段有限时间或无限时间)，要求被试通过移动数轴上的点以标定实验材料在被试心中的长度。

本脚本是基于MATLAB psychtoolbox-3对数轴范式的实现。
