# PsychAxis
The numerical axis paradigm is a commonly used paradigm in **Construal Level Theory (CLT)**, typically utilized to measure individuals' perception of distances related to abstract concepts such as time and social relationships. Its common form involves presenting a numerical axis and explaining its properties and meaning (e.g., whether the axis is finite or infinite, representing a finite period or infinite time). Participants are then required to move a point along the axis to indicate the perceived length of the experimental material in their minds.

This script implements the numerical axis paradigm using MATLAB's Psychtoolbox-3.


数轴范式是**解释水平理论**常用的范式之一，一般用于测量个体对时间、社会关系等抽象概念的距离知觉。其常见形式是给出一段数轴并说明其性质及含义(比如数轴有限长或无限长，代表一段有限时间或无限时间)，要求被试通过移动数轴上的点以标定实验材料在被试心中的长度。

本脚本是基于MATLAB psychtoolbox-3对数轴范式的实现。
